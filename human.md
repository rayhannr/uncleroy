## ✨ Features

- **🗣️ Tri-lingual AI**: Chat naturally in English, Indonesian, or Javanese.
- **🤖 24/7 Telegram Bot**: Add places and get suggestions on the go.
- **🗺️ Smart Links**: Just paste a Google Maps link, and the AI handles the rest (Name, City, Distance, Travel Time).
- **🔋 Powered by Google Sheets**: Your data is yours. Easy to view, edit, and export manually.
- **🎯 Smart Recommendations**:
  - `Nearby`: Find spots closest to you.
  - `Quickest`: Find spots with the shortest travel time.
  - `Surprise Me`: Random picks from your list.
  - `By City`: Filter spots in a specific city.
  - `Search by Name`: Fuzzy search your tracker by place name.
- **🌍 Global Discovery**: Search for new places directly on Google Maps (outside your tracker). Returns top 3 results with a direct Maps link.
- **✅ Visit Tracking**:
  - Mark places as visited to keep track of your journey.
  - `Unvisit`: Easily clear visit dates if you make a mistake.
- **🗑️ Delete Capability**:
  - Delete places permanently from your tracker.
  - Automatically shifts up subsequent rows in Google Sheets to keep it clean.
- **🔢 Priority Queue**:
  - Rank the places you want to go to next (1 = go there first).
  - Insert a place at any rank and the rest automatically shift to stay contiguous.
  - Visiting or deleting a prioritized place automatically clears its rank and renumbers the queue.
- **🌌 Midnight & Neon UI**: A sleek, high-contrast dark theme with glassmorphism.
- **📍 Real-time Geolocation**: 
  - Web: One-click "Go Live" location tracking.
  - Telegram: Send your pin for persistent, cross-platform location sync.
  - `Smart Recalculation`: Only updates your list when you move >2km.
- **🔔 Sonner Notifications**: High-end toast notifications for real-time status updates.
- **🎡 Wheel of Places**: Spin an interactive wheel to randomly decide where to eat. Cherry-pick entries, filter by visit status, and search by name or city. Already-picked places are struck through and excluded from subsequent spins.
- **🔌 Model Context Protocol (MCP)**: Connect your tracker directly to AI clients (like Claude Desktop) via a built-in MCP server endpoint (`/api/mcp`).
- **🛡️ Per-Tool Rate Limiting**: Upstash Redis sliding-window limits protect Google API calls from runaway AI loops or Telegram webhook replays. Separate counters for demo and prod, graceful no-op in local dev.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Prerequisites
- A Google Cloud Project with Sheets, Geocoding, and Routes APIs enabled.
- A service account with access to your Google Sheet.
- A Telegram Bot token from [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather).
- Mistral AI API Key.

### 2. Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file based on the following:

```env
MISTRAL_API_KEY=your_key
SPREADSHEET_ID=your_sheet_id
GMAPS_API_KEY=your_key
GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=path_to_json
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=your_bot_token
TELEGRAM_ALLOWED_USER_ID=your_id
REFERENCE_LAT=your_home_lat
REFERENCE_LNG=your_home_lng

# Optional: enable demo mode (no Google credentials needed)
DEMO_MODE=true
BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN=your_vercel_blob_token

# Optional: Upstash Redis for per-tool rate limiting
UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL=your_upstash_url
UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN=your_upstash_token
```

> **Demo Mode**: Designed for public or portfolio deployments where you don't want to expose your personal Google Sheet. When `DEMO_MODE=true`, the app uses Vercel Blob storage instead of Google Sheets — no Google credentials required. The Telegram bot is disabled and a 75-place limit is enforced to keep the shared store clean.

### 3. Installation
```bash
npm install
```

### 4. Running Locally
```bash
npm run dev
```

### 5. Telegram Webhook Setup
To use the Telegram bot in production or with a tunnel:
```bash
npm run telegram:set-webhook
```

### 6. Model Context Protocol (MCP) Setup
You can connect this app directly to MCP-compatible AI clients (such as Claude Desktop) as a remote tool server.

The endpoint is served at `/api/mcp` (disabled when `DEMO_MODE=true`).

#### Claude Desktop Integration
Add this to your `claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "places-to-go": {
      "transport": {
        "type": "sse",
        "url": "http://localhost:3000/api/mcp"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### 7. CLI
A local command-line interface, `ptg.sh`, is included for scripting and quick lookups without opening the browser or Telegram.

```bash
# Direct commands — one per AI tool, args validated the same way
./ptg.sh get-random-places --count 3
./ptg.sh add-place --link "https://maps.app.goo.gl/xxxx" --category "japanese,ramen"
./ptg.sh get-priority-places

# Interactive AI chat mode — same persona/tools as web & Telegram, needs MISTRAL_API_KEY
./ptg.sh chat

# Full option list per command
./ptg.sh add-place --help
```

Reads `.env` the same way `npm run telegram:set-webhook` does, so the same environment variables apply. Mutating commands (`add-place`, `update-place`, `delete-place`, `visit-place`, `prioritize-place`, `sync-all-distances`) go through the same per-tool rate limiter as the web/Telegram front ends, since they share the same Google API quota.
