## Review

This book was written by a psychiatrist and mental health expert, so we can trust that everything discussed about depression is backed by professional knowledge. The author covers a wide range of topics related to depression, including its causes and triggers, the mindset associated with it, strategies for overcoming it, mindfulness techniques, how to manage self-harm tendencies, how to prevent depression from recurring, how to support someone with depression, and much more.

The author encourages us to recognize that emotional wounds can lead to depression, which, in severe cases, may result in self-harm or even suicide. Through an accessible and engaging writing style, the author provides clear definitions on both depression and emotional wounds, aiming to foster a healthy mindset.
