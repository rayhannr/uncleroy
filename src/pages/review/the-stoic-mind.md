## Review

`The Stoic Mind` is a compelling guide that brings the ancient wisdom of Stoicism into the modern world. This book is an invaluable resource for anyone looking to cultivate resilience, emotional intelligence, and a sense of tranquility amidst life's challenges. The good thing is, you can get this book for free from [Google Play Books](https://play.google.com/store/books/details/Addy_Osmani_The_Stoic_Mind?id=ylfPEAAAQBAJ&hl=en).

The book is organized into clear, concise chapters that each focus on different aspects of Stoic thought, such as the importance of distinguishing between what we can and cannot control, the value of self-discipline, and the practice of mindfulness and presence. All of them are translated into practical advices that can be applied in today's fast-paced society.

One of the standout features of `The Stoic Mind` is its emphasis on actionable insights. Osmani doesn't just explain Stoic principles, he provides readers with practical exercises and real-world applications to integrate these timeless teachings into their daily routines. One example is in the first chapter about balancing between work and life, the book advises us to:

- Prioritize relationships with loved ones as they are our vital support system
- Invest in health physically, mentally, and emotionally. Exercise regularly, eat healthily, and seek professional help when necessary
- Pursue personal interest. Make time for hobbies outside of work
- Set boundaries between work and personal life. Avoid bringing work home
- Embrace long-life learning

## Lesson learned

There is a wealth of knowledge to gain from this book, but here are a few key takeaways that have particularly resonated with me:

### Work is just one piece of the puzzle

Achieving professional success and financial security are crucial, but don't let work overshadow other important aspects of life. Focusing solely on our career can lead to neglecting critical areas such as family, health, and personal growth that contribute to a fulfilling life.

### Just start

Perfection isn't necessary when starting something new, and becoming a master right away is unrealistic. The key is to take action, as it leads to progress.

Our focus should be on progress rather than perfection. It's more valuable to get something out into the world than to wait for the perfect moment. Once we start, we can refine and improve by learning from feedback, identifying areas for enhancement, and making adjustments. This continuous improvement process brings us closer to achieving the ideal result.

Starting is more than half the battle. Waiting for the perfect moment is futile because it may never arrive. Embrace the power of starting and iterate until we reach satisfaction.

### Focus on what we can control

When we focus on what's within our control, we allocate our time and resources more efficiently. Narrowing our attention helps us avoid distractions and noise, which often consume a significant amount of our valuable time.

### Don't measure our life with someone else's ruler

We often compare our behind-the-scenes with someone else's highlight reel. We see their successes but not their struggles and failures, making it an inaccurate measure for comparison.

Evaluate our progress based on our past performance and next goal, not someone else's. Am I better than I was yesterday? Am I moving closer to achieving my goals?

If someone has achieved what we aspire to, it proves it's possible. Rather than feeling discouraged by their success, learn from their journey. Take inspiration from others, but maintain our own metrics
