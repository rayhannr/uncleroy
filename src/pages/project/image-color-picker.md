As a former Photoshop designer, one of my most frequent tasks was color picking from images. Even after discontinuing my Photoshop subscription and shifting focus to frontend development, I found myself needing this function regularly. In such cases, I resorted to using online tools instead.

This got me thinking, "What if I create the same tool myself? Not only to meet my own needs but also to gain more experience in app development."

Hence, I created `Image Color Picker`. Being a fan of Tailwind CSS and using it in all of my personal projects, I incorporated it into this tool. In addition to displaying the actual picked color, it also shows the closest Tailwind color.
