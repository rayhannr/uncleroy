`Kantle` was developed as a clone of [Wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html), where players attempt to guess a five-letter word within six attempts, receiving feedback for each guess through colored tiles indicating correct letters and positions.

There's a similar clone in Indonesian called [Katla](https://katla.id/), so I made some modifications, allowing players to guess a six-letter word instead.
