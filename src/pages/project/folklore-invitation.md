I built this wedding invitation page using [Next](https://nextjs.org/). To facilitate guests in sending their best wishes to the bride and groom, I integrated Next's API routes with [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/). I intentionally avoided incorporating excessive animations or autoplaying music, as I find these elements irritating in invitations I received from friends.

I named it `` `folklore-invitation` `` to embody the vibe of Taylor Swift's album "folklore." This is evident through the background image and font I chose.

I maintain this invitation as a template for future use, sparing me the effort of starting from scratch when needed.
