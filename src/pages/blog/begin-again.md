I've had several blogging experiences, each marking a different phase in my journey. In total, I can identify at least three such phases.

## First phase: Junior high school

During an IT class, our teacher instructed us to create personal blogs for self-introductions, utilizing Blogspot as the platform. Initially, I settled for a basic template and wrote a single introductory post, meeting the initial requirement. However, upon observing my friends enhance their blogs with custom themes such as Naruto, I felt compelled to join in to avoid missing out.

The blog was adorned with various widgets, including a visitor counter, text that spun around the cursor, autoplaying songs, and other eccentric additions. In hindsight, I view these elements with a sense of cringe from my more mature perspective. However, as a junior high school student, I found them intriguing and cool at the time.

During this phase, I published numerous blog posts, although I didn't actually write them myself. Instead, I simply shared random content from Wikipedia. Looking back, I recognize it as a rather pathetic way to begin my blogging journey. Consequently, I permanently deleted that blog for good.

## Second phase: College

I paused my blogging activities during my final year of junior high school, only to begin again once I entered college. In my freshman year, I took on the role of a social media admin. The content was primarily provided by other team members or obtained from third-party sources. My responsibility was to post this content using our own poster designs.

The role of a social media admin inspired me to share my own written content. Initially, I chose to publish them on LINE, as it was widely popular among high school and college students at the time. LINE, known primarily as a chat app, offered a feed feature, which, at the time of writing, is called LINE VOOM.

After repeatedly publishing my own writings, I eventually decided to transition to a blog format. I opted for WordPress, as it was the platform I was most comfortable and familiar with.

Reflecting on those experiences, I can't help but cringe a bit, realizing that I shared quite a few personal details that probably shouldn't have been made public. Thus, similar to my first blog, I chose to permanently remove this one as well, aiming to eliminate any embarrassing digital traces.

## Third phase: Working adult

This represents the current stage of my journey. Now proficient as a frontend engineer, I no longer require CMS platforms like Blogspot or WordPress to create websites. This led me to develop my new blog using [Astro](https://astro.build/). My goal for this blog is to avoid delving too deeply into personal matters. Instead, I plan to share technical stuff and showcase my projects as well. If I do decide to write about my personal experiences, I hope it will be content that I won't regret sharing later on.

So I guess that's it. On a Sunday in a cafe, I begin to blog again.
