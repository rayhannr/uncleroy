A couple of weeks ago, I came across a PDF containing 260 marriage-related questions on X. It turns out, the file was from [Suhbah Institute](https://suhbah.com/).

If you're serious about getting to know someone better, especially when thinking about marriage but you're unsure of the right questions to ask, this website can definitely inspire you.

The questions cover a variety of important topics like family, finances, religion, career, past relationships, and more. On the website, you'll also find sample answers for each of them.

While I could have answered the questions myself, I decided to use [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/) to generate responses for the site.

I’ve already answered them myself for my own future use, though I’ve kept those private because, honestly, why would I share something so personal with the public?

The Q&As are accessible in formal English and casual Indonesian. I chose formal English because that’s how they were originally structured, while I used casual Indonesian because it’s my native language and feels far more natural.

Let’s be honest, formal Indonesian feels unnecessarily stiff.

Lastly, if you're curious, this website is built using Astro, taking advantage of its built-in [i18n support](https://docs.astro.build/en/recipes/i18n/), along with [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) and [shadcn](https://ui.shadcn.com/). Pretty standard setup for a modern website, really.
