`Talangeen` is an app that enables users to track shared expenses with friends, ensuring everyone gets reimbursed.

It was inspired by a real-world problem I encountered while traveling with friends. Whenever we spent money on things like food, lodging, or tickets to tourist attractions, one person would pay for everyone. At the end of the day, we would list all our expenses and split the bill.

Calculating the bills each of us owed was a painstaking process. That's why I created `Talangeen`. Now, all we have to do is enter our names and the transactions we've made, and `Talangeen` swiftly handles the calculations, far more efficiently than manual effort.
